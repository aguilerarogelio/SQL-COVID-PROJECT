#COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis Project
This project involves a comprehensive exploration, cleansing, and analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL. The dataset includes COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination data from various locations globally. The main goals of the project are to explore relationships between infection rates, death counts, and vaccination efforts across different regions, and to prepare insights for data visualization platforms like Tableau.

Data Exploration:
Performed exploratory analysis on global COVID-19 data, examining cases, deaths, and population impacts across multiple countries and continents.

Data Cleansing:
Removed irrelevant data (e.g., income-related locations) and merged redundant entries such as "Europe" and "European Union" to maintain consistency.

Analysis:
Calculated COVID-19 death percentages by location and date.
Analyzed infection rates in relation to population.
Identified countries and continents with the highest infection and death counts.

Vaccination Analysis:
Examined vaccination rates by calculating the percentage of vaccinated population over time.
Created a temporary table and views for further insights, partitioning vaccination data by location and date.

Views for Visualization:
Created views for integration with Tableau, enabling clear visualization of COVID-19 vaccination trends and death counts across various locations.
This project highlights my ability to manipulate large datasets, apply cleansing techniques, and derive meaningful insights for public health monitoring and reporting.
